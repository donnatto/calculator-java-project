# calculator-java-project

This is a project made for the **Algorithms and Data Structure** Course which I'm taking as of June 2019.

Basically, it allows users to input a Infix Expression using a Calculator Interface. This is  transformed into a Postfix Expression
using an algorithm, and finally, using another one, this expression is evaluated and returns the answer to the Calculator Interface.

This application is developed in Java using **NetBeans** 8.2
